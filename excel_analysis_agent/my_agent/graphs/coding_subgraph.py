def create_coding_subgraph():
    """
    Create the Coding Agent subgraph with properly isolated state.

    This subgraph uses:
    - CodingSubgraphInput: Controls what flows FROM parent TO subgraph (no messages)
    - CodingSubgraphState: Internal state with ALL messages including tool calls
    - CodingSubgraphOutput: Controls what flows FROM subgraph TO parent (only final message)

    This ensures:
    - Parent graph messages DON'T enter the subgraph
    - Tool calls and internal messages stay INSIDE the subgraph
    - Only the clean final analysis message flows back to parent

    Workflow:
    1. Coding Agent generates code and decides to use tools
    2. Tools are executed (messages stay in subgraph)
    3. Results are fed back to the Coding Agent (internal loop)
    4. Process repeats until analysis is complete or max iterations reached
    5. Final analysis is compiled and sent to parent graph

    The subgraph uses conditional routing to handle:
    - Tool execution when the agent calls tools
    - Continuation when more reasoning is needed
    - Finalization when the analysis is complete

    Returns:
        Compiled LangGraph subgraph for coding agent with input/output schemas
