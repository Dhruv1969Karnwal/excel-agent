first we create application using  
 - http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/application.create post request 
 - body {
  "name": "name accordingly ",
  "environmentId": "A71ogw4aDRXiXT7-f6DL2"
}
it return a josn resposen from that in store the {
    "applicationId": "ihzvb3OfkzKKafZjHzCPY",
    "name": "PYTHON DHRUV Uvicorn - test new ",
    "appName": "app-copy-neural-matrix-dor5f6", }

make sure application name is unique always 



second - 
http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/trpc/application.dropDeployment

in that use form data to applicationId and zip 

now what is zip file   the llm given the code teh execute save in the app/main.py
and 2 otehr files at app folder level is one is Dockerfile and other is requirements.txt  present in the root directory of the zip filr  

Dockerfile - FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app ./app

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

requirements.txt - 
"pandas",
            "numpy",
            "openpyxl",
            "matplotlib",
            "seaborn",
            "scipy",
            "statsmodels",
            "scikit-learn",
            "tabulate",
            "python-dateutil",


{
    "result": {
        "data": {
            "json": true
        }
    }
}





third is after POST http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/application.saveBuildType 

{
  "applicationId": "BYTpBGzcJYka0VI6yblxE",
  "buildType": "dockerfile",
  "publishDirectory": null,
  "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
  "dockerContextPath": "",
  "dockerBuildStage": "",
  "herokuVersion": null,
  "isStaticSpa": null,
  "railpackVersion": null
}

use same applicatioID  it return true  json ( i think)


forst is http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/application.deploy 

body is {
    "applicationId":"BYTpBGzcJYka0VI6yblxE"
}

than it send the 200 status 


fifth is  http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/deployment.all?applicationId=ihzvb3OfkzKKafZjHzCPY   
it return array of josn than check the first list and check that  [
    {
        "deploymentId": "mIdIF7n7B2JODlv4rccbo",
        "title": "Manual deployment",
        "description": "",
        "status": "done",
        "logPath": "/etc/dokploy/logs/app-copy-neural-matrix-dor5f6/app-copy-neural-matrix-dor5f6-2026-01-08:19:41:44.log",
        "pid": null,
        "applicationId": "ihzvb3OfkzKKafZjHzCPY",
        "composeId": null,
        "serverId": null,
        "isPreviewDeployment": false,
        "previewDeploymentId": null,
        "createdAt": "2026-01-08T19:41:44.585Z",
        "startedAt": "2026-01-08T19:41:44.585Z",
        "finishedAt": "2026-01-08T19:41:44.864Z",
        "errorMessage": null,
        "scheduleId": null,
        "backupId": null,
        "rollbackId": null,
        "volumeBackupId": null,
        "buildServerId": null
    },] and check that status : if done means all correct than means containes is setup successfully 




sixth than we make a end point to got the container id is   http://35.232.206.182:3000/api/trpc/organization.all,user.getInvitations,application.one,docker.getContainersByAppNameMatch,environment.byProjectId,docker.getConfig?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3Anull%2C%22meta%22%3A%7B%22values%22%3A%5B%22undefined%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%221%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3Anull%2C%22meta%22%3A%7B%22values%22%3A%5B%22undefined%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%222%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22applicationId%22%3A%22BYTpBGzcJYka0VI6yblxE%22%7D%7D%2C%223%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22appName%22%3A%22app-compress-online-bus-ycosyy%22%2C%22serverId%22%3A%22%22%7D%7D%2C%224%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22projectId%22%3A%22lOOolgBk2tY-wpFRvySUk%22%7D%7D%2C%225%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22containerId%22%3A%22select-a-container%22%2C%22serverId%22%3A%22%22%7D%7D%7D 
looks liek this 

this return me conatienr id store that 



seventh make a web seocket connect to print the terminal outputs - ws://35.232.206.182:3000/listen-deployment?logPath=/etc/dokploy/logs/etc/dokploy/logs/app-compress-online-bus-ycosyy/app-compress-online-bus-ycosyy-2026-01-08:11:11:18.log   and use   x-api-key:codemateIgJZLeRwPQqKFyOvHXJifnUhwxAGsUucVXWxFqjxkaAHdzczpFACUWZDUHCGJhiK   

not questyion is that how to got the   logPath=/etc/do ??
it commes form that fifth steps log file path "logPath": "/etc/dokploy/logs/app-copy-  


than same like in sandbox send the output back to the node
